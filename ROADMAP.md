# StockPredict Data Mining Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for the StockPredict system's data mining capabilities. We're focusing on three core algorithms that provide the most value for stock market analysis and prediction.

## Core Algorithms

### 1. Price Pattern Recognition
- **Current State**: Detects support/resistance levels, trend changes, and double tops/bottoms
- **Next Steps**:
  - Improve accuracy of pattern detection with machine learning validation
  - Add head-and-shoulders pattern detection
  - Incorporate volume confirmation for pattern reliability
  - Create visualization tools for pattern identification

### 2. SMA Crossover Signal Detection
- **Current State**: Detects trading signals based on SMA crossovers with configurable periods
- **Next Steps**:
  - Add exponential moving average (EMA) crossover detection
  - Implement adaptive period selection based on volatility
  - Add signal strength scoring based on volume confirmation
  - Create backtesting framework to validate signal performance

### 3. Anomaly Detection
- **Current State**: Calculates anomaly scores based on price and volume movements
- **Next Steps**:
  - Implement machine learning-based anomaly detection using isolation forests
  - Add correlation with external market factors (VIX, sector performance)
  - Create real-time alert system for detected anomalies
  - Develop visualization for historical anomalies and their outcomes

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Refinement (Weeks 1-2)
- Optimize existing algorithms for performance
- Add unit tests for all core functions
- Create comprehensive documentation

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Weeks 3-4)
- Implement the "Next Steps" items from each core algorithm
- Develop backtesting framework
- Create initial visualization tools

### Phase 3: Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- Combine all three algorithms into a unified analysis tool
- Implement user-friendly GUI for analysis results
- Create exportable reports and alerts

### Phase 4: Validation (Weeks 7-8)
- Extensive backtesting across multiple market conditions
- Performance optimization
- User feedback implementation

## Key Performance Indicators

1. **Pattern Recognition Accuracy**: >75% correct identification of pattern outcomes
2. **Signal Detection Precision**: >65% profitable trades based on crossover signals
3. **Anomaly Detection Recall**: >80% of significant price movements preceded by anomaly detection
4. **System Performance**: Analysis of 10 years of daily data in <5 seconds

## Future Directions

- Integration with real-time data feeds
- Cloud-based analysis service
- Mobile application for alerts and visualization
- Machine learning model enhancement using deep learning techniques
