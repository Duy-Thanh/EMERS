# Emergency Market Event Response System (EMERS)

EMERS is an advanced stock market prediction and analysis platform designed to detect, quantify, and respond to major market-moving events such as policy changes, geopolitical crises, and economic shocks. Built with C and optimized with inline Assembly, EMERS provides real-time analysis and defensive strategy recommendations during periods of market turbulence.

## Developers

nekkochan0x0007 (Nguyen Duy Thanh)

## Features

- Real-time detection and classification of market-moving events
- Quantitative measurement of event impact on various market sectors
- Advanced technical analysis with multiple indicators
- Generation of defensive investment strategies
- Integration with Tiingo API for market data

## Technical Indicators

EMERS implements the following technical indicators:
- Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- Bollinger Bands
- Average True Range (ATR)

## Event Detection

The system detects various types of market events:
- Price movements
- Volatility spikes
- Volume spikes
- News-based events

## Requirements

- C compiler (GCC recommended)
- curl command line tool (must be in your PATH)
- Tiingo API key (register at https://api.tiingo.com/)

## Building

```bash
# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p obj bin

# Build the project
make
```

## Building on Windows

```bash
# No need to create directories manually, the Makefile will handle it
make
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
bin/emers -k YOUR_TIINGO_API_KEY -s AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL

# With date range
bin/emers -k YOUR_TIINGO_API_KEY -s AAPL --start-date 2023-01-01 --end-date 2023-12-31
```

### Command Line Arguments

- `-k, --api-key KEY`: Your Tiingo API key
- `-s, --symbols SYM1,SYM2`: Comma-separated list of stock symbols to analyze
- `--start-date DATE`: Start date for analysis (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `--end-date DATE`: End date for analysis (YYYY-MM-DD format)

## Project Structure

- `include/`: Header files
- `src/`: Source code
- `lib/`: Library files
- `test/`: Test files
- `obj/`: Object files (created during build)
- `bin/`: Binary files (created during build)
